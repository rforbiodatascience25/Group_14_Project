## Load Libraries

We start by loading the relevant libraries.

```{r}
#| message: false
library("tidyverse")
library("ggridges")
```

## Load Data

The two different datasets are loaded into the document and saved as data1 and data2. When viewing the two files, we see that they both contain ReefID_Name as the first column. This column is untidy since we have two different informations in one cell.

```{r}
#| message: false
data1 <- read_csv("../data/_raw/reef_data_dataset1.csv")
data2 <- read_csv("../data/_raw/reef_data_dataset2.csv")
```
